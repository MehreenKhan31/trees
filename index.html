        <h1>Trees</h1>
        <img src="image.jpeg">
        <p>Although "tree" is a term of common parlance, 
            there is no universally recognised precise definition
             of what a tree is, either botanically or in common language.
             [1][2] In its broadest sense, a tree is any plant with the 
             general form of an elongated stem, or trunk, which supports
              the photosynthetic leaves or branches at some distance 
              above the ground.[3] Trees are also typically defined by
               height,[4] with smaller plants from 0.5 to 10 m (1.6 to 
               32.8 ft) being called shrubs,[5] so the minimum height of
                a tree is only loosely defined.[4] Large herbaceous 
                plants such as papaya and bananas are trees in this broad
                 sense.[2][6]
<br>
            A commonly applied narrower definition is that a tree has a 
            woody trunk formed by secondary growth, meaning that the
             trunk thickens each year by growing outwards, in addition
              to the primary upwards growth from the growing tip.[4][7]
               Under such a definition, herbaceous plants such as palms,
                bananas and papayas are not considered trees regardless 
                of their height, growth form or stem girth. Certain
                 monocots may be considered trees under a slightly looser
                  definition;[8] while the Joshua tree, bamboos and palms
                   do not have secondary growth and never produce true 
                   wood with growth rings,[9][10] they may produce 
                   <br>
                   "pseudo-wood" by lignifying cells formed by primary
                    growth.[11] Tree species in the genus Dracaena, 
                    despite also being monocots, do have secondary 
                    growth caused by meristem in their trunk, but it is 
                    different from the thickening meristem found in 
                    dicotyledonous trees.[12]
            
            Aside from structural definitions, trees are commonly defined by use; for instance, as those plants which yield lumber.[13]</p>
            <h2> <i>The Advantages of trees</i></h2>
            <p> Trees give off oxygen that we need to breathe. Trees reduce the amount of storm
                 water runoff, which reduces erosion and pollution in our w
                 aterways and may reduce the effects of flooding. Many species
                  of wildlife depend on trees for habitat. Trees provide food,
                   protection, and homes for many birds and mammals.
                   Here are five reasons we need trees:
                
.Trees purify our air and combat climate change. ...<br>
.Trees provide housing to millions of species that protect us from disease. ...<br>
.Trees cool our streets and cities. ...<br>
.Trees protect against floods and water pollution. ...<br>
.Trees ease the mind during stressful times.<br></p>
<h2>Disadvantages of not planting trees</h2>
<p>The loss of trees and other vegetation can cause climate change, desertification, soil erosion, fewer crops, flooding, increased greenhouse gases
     in the atmosphere, and a host of problems for Indigenous people.<br>
     There are many disadvantages, it will affect the water cycle, it will destroy the flora and fauna, it will lead to an increase in carbon dioxide, thereby increasing global warming. Cutting trees destroys the habitat of animals and birds, causes floods and fires, limits the supply of wood or timber.
